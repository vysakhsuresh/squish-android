"""Check that every library the source imports is one the module actually declares.

This exists because of a failure that read as four unrelated compiler errors and
was none of them. The app imported `androidx.compose.foundation` in four hundred
places and `androidx.compose.runtime` in a hundred, and declared neither - both
arrived behind material3. A transitive dependency is a version somebody else
chose, and when the Compose runtime it landed on was out of step with the Compose
compiler, the error said "Cannot access class ComposableFunction1", and then
every `Row { }` in the file lost its scope and `Modifier.weight` went unresolved.
Nothing pointed at the build file.

The rule is the plain one: if you import it, declare it. The table below maps an
import prefix to the Gradle alias that provides it; a prefix with no entry is
reported too, so the table cannot quietly fall behind the source.

Run with no arguments from the repo root.
